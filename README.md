Payday 2 Save Manager
==================

I'm a huge fan of Payday 2, the incredible first person shooter by Overkill Software. Unfortunately due to occasional bugs, beta updates and mod usage going wrong occasionally your game saves may be in danger. Of course the common route was to manually copy and paste your save files somewhere else, but that got annoying to me. I decided to build a nice user interface for easy backup and recovery of my game saves. 

Features:  
-The ability to backup and recover Payday 2 game saves  
-Works with multiple Steam accounts on the same machine  
-Functions locally, and does not require Steam or any other credentials  
-Custom name your backups  
-Debug Window outputs everything that is donefor user logging  
-Easy Deletion of older unwanted backups
